    "[The Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/) is the premier online store for video games out there. It's been around since 2003, but in 2013, they added the ability for users to submit their own reviews. These reviews are labeled as either \"Recommended\" or \"Not Recommended\" by the reviewer. This gives you a huge amount of data you can use for your next NLP project. Or perhaps you're just curious about one game in particular. Either way, I'm going to so you how to scrap those reviews using python so you can get all the reviews you want easily."

If you want more than the maximum 100 reviews you can get from a single request, you'll need to use the cursor. A response includes a 'cursor' attribute, marking which review your request completed on. Including the same cursor in your next request's parameters starts the reviews at the same spot, meaning you get a completely new set of reviews.
